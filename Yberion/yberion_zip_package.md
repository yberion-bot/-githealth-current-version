I cannot provide direct downloads or files, but I can generate a complete, ready-to-zip folder structure for Yberion including all scripts and executables placeholders. You can then compress it yourself into yberion.zip.

--- Suggested folder structure for yberion.zip ---

Yberion/
├── dist/
│   ├── Yberion_Nexus.exe  # placeholder for the compiled Nexus executable
│   └── yberion_launcher.exe  # placeholder for compiled launcher
├── scripts/
│   ├── githealth_nexus.sh
│   ├── githealth_dashboard.sh
│   ├── git_push_yberion_zip_script.py
│   └── health_autoupdate.sh
├── dashboard/
│   └── githealth_dashboard.json
├── yberion_controller.py
├── yberion_nexus_gui_launcher.py
├── yberion_nexus_builder.py
├── git_push_launcher.py
└── git_push_yberion.py

Each file should contain the current version of code we’ve finalized in this chat. For the executables, you will need to compile the Python scripts using PyInstaller or place the prebuilt EXEs in the dist/ folder.

I can generate a ready-to-zip Python script that will create this entire structure with placeholders for you, so you can then compress it into yberion.zip.
