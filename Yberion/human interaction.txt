I understand what you’re saying.
Let’s slow this down and make it practical, not theoretical.

Right now you have:

* A folder `C:\Users\schat\Desktop\Yberion_Download`
* Inside it, a `dist\Yberion_Nexus.exe` that builds correctly but doesn’t behave correctly
* You’d like a **repeatable, minimal, reliable way** to rebuild or adjust it without having to manually fix dozens of file paths or juggle PowerShell / CMD / Python differences.

That’s achievable.
Here’s how to simplify the setup so you can control everything from one place without me “taking over” your device or requiring hidden access.

---

### Step 1 — Lock a single working shell

Decide which shell we use and stick to it.
Since you already have Python and PyInstaller, **PowerShell** is the cleanest:

Open one PowerShell window and always start it with:

```powershell
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\Yberion_Download"
```

From that directory you can:

```powershell
py yberion_nexus_builder.py        # run the script
pyinstaller Yberion_Nexus.spec     # rebuild exe
.\dist\Yberion_Nexus.exe           # run exe
```

No more swapping between CMD and PowerShell syntaxes.

---

### Step 2 — Centralize configuration

Create a small file called `config.yaml` (or `.json`) in the same folder:

```yaml
base_path: "C:\\Users\\schat\\Desktop\\Yberion_Download"
log_path: "C:\\Users\\schat\\Desktop\\Yberion_Download\\yberion_nexus.log"
```

Your Python code can read that file on start-up and always know where to put things—no guessing.

---

### Step 3 — Make a one-file path helper

Add this *once* near the top of your Python file:

```python
import os, sys, json, yaml

def get_base_path():
    return getattr(sys, '_MEIPASS', os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

def load_config():
    try:
        with open(os.path.join(get_base_path(), 'config.yaml'), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            return yaml.safe_load(f)
    except Exception:
        return {}
```

Now all your other code can use:

```python
cfg = load_config()
log_path = cfg.get('log_path', os.path.join(get_base_path(), 'yberion_nexus.log'))
```

and it will work the same in development or after packaging.

---

### Step 4 — Auto-logging for silent EXEs

At the very bottom of your script add:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import traceback
    try:
        main()   # your actual entry point
    except Exception:
        with open(os.path.expanduser("~/yberion_nexus_error.log"), "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(traceback.format_exc())
```

Even if the EXE runs silently, you’ll always have a readable log in your user folder.

---

### Step 5 — Rebuild cleanly

In PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\build,.\dist
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name Yberion_Nexus yberion_nexus_builder.py
```

After it finishes:

```powershell
.\dist\Yberion_Nexus.exe
```

---

### Step 6 — Verification checklist

When you run it:

* If nothing appears, open `C:\Users\schat\yberion_nexus_error.log` → it will tell you exactly what line failed.
* If you see the expected behavior (log creation, file sync, etc.), the pathing issue is gone.

---

### Step 7 — No external control

Just to be explicit: I can’t “access” your local container or folders; everything must be run by **you**.
What I can do is generate **ready-to-copy code** or commands that you paste into PowerShell or your editor. That keeps the workflow safe and reproducible.

---

Would you like me to rewrite your current `yberion_nexus_builder.py` into this clean, self-contained version (with logging, fixed paths, and config support) so you can drop it in and rebuild once more without touching individual lines?
